bootstrap is very firmly on the front end.
It's a bunch of code that was written to 
be reusable that you can drop into your 
site and it'll make designing the Web site
much much easier for you.
Now Bootstrap was originally developed by Twitter 
in order to try and get more consistent across 
Web sites that they design.
But since then they've made it free and open source.

as the number of users are moving away from desktop 
towards mobile a lot of Web sites need to be responsive.
responsive just means that it responds to the viewport.
So that means if you're looking at the same web site on 
mobile or on iPad or on desktop it should have
different lay out to be able to best take advantage of 
the size of the screen. a better word would almost be 
something like adaptable layout.

you get access to a whole bunch of pre-start elements 
that you can simply just drop and your code with very 
very minimal effort.

In HTML5 there is a element called the Nav
and this is kind of similar to a div but
semantically it's more clear
similar to a div if the nav doesn't
have any content it doesn't have many 
dimensions.

all uses of left and right have been replaced 
with start and end in Bootstrap 5...

if your custom styles are not overriding 
the bootstrap styles, all you need to do 
is move the link to your custom stylesheet 
to a line after the bootstrap CDN link:
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/
bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
This means that you first load the default 
bootstrap styles, then you can override some 
of those components with your own custom CSS.
Unlike CSS and JavaScript, HTML code is executed 
from top to bottom so the order of your code matters.

* card deck dropped in V5
Dropped .card-deck in favor of our grid. 
Wrap your cards in column classes and add a 
parent .row-cols-* container to recreate 
card decks (but with more control over responsive 
alignment).

Use <div class="card-group"> and edit with grid 
format instead. Card-deck is not supported in 
Bootstrap 5.

Advance css
------------

* Multiple selectors :-

selector1, selector2 {

}

ex:
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6{
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}

* Hierarchical selectors

order is first selector iss from parent
and second selector is from child

selector1 selector2{

}

read from right to left.

ex:
#title .container-fluid{
    padding: 7% 15% 7%;   
}

* combined selectors

selector1.selector2{

}

or

selector1#selector2{

}
they have to occur in same element

ex:
<div class="container-fluid">
   <h1 id="title">Hello World</h1>
</div>

h1#title{
    color:red;
}

or

div.container-fluid{
    color:red;
}

This is not valid code because 
currently on screen we don't have 
a single div that has the ID of 
title. We only have a div that has
a child with the ID of title and 
this doesn't work we will have to use 
Hierarchical selector.

div#title {
    color:red;
}
