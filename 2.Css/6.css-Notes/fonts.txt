there are two major font families 
1.Serif
2.sans-serif 
we style code using monospace
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp

when we set the font family for ex: 
font-family: verdana ,sans-serif
it first asks the browser to try and render 
all the text in the verdana font , now if for some
reason the browser or the OS that the user is using  
does'nt have this font installed then it will 
default to whatever sans serif font is installed
on their system.

font-embedding
we can embedd font to our site by copying the link and 
by pasting it into head tag. this link specifies a location
if users dont have these fonts installed,then the browser
will take them to this location and grab those fonts for them
then we can just specify the font family in the style.

However GIFs are a terrible format 
for storing video and are often huge 
in size leading to slow page load times 
and high data usage.
