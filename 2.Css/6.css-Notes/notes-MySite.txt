text-align: center; inside the container or the parent
element will center everything inside that does,nt have a
width set , if it is a block element and it has a width set
then you are going to center it using margin
h1{
  /* width: 10%; */
  /* T R B L clockwise */
  /* margin: 0 auto 0 auto; */
  /* TB LR */
  /* margin: 0 auto */
  margin: 50px auto 0 auto;
  font-family: 'Sacramento', cursive;
  font-size: 5.62rem;
  color: #7C83FD;
  line-height: 2;
}

In order to position a element relative to something
one of its parent should have relative position otherrwise 
it is relative to the body 
#top-container{
  background-color: #DBE6FD;
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 100px;
}
.code{
  position: absolute;
  left:12%;
  top:43%;
  width: 13%;
}
.keyboard{
  position: absolute;
  right:16%;
  top:5%;
  width:13%;
}

Now sometimes when you float an element you might not want 
all of the text to be wrapped around it.
example say if we only wanted that title to wrap around this 
image and to be on the right of
the image then we can actually use another property to make 
sure that  text does not wrap and end up at the bottom.
that property is called clear

.skills-img{
  width: 25%;
  float: left;
  margin-right:30px ;
}
.skills-img-second{
  width: 25%;
  float: right;
  margin-left:30px ;
}

.skills-description{
  clear:left;
}
.skills-description-second{
  clear: right;
}

DO NOT USE FLOAT FOR POSITIONING
