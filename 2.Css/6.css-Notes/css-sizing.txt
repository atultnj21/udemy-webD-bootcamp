font-size: 96px  :- static sizing
font-size: 5em   :- dynamic sizing  em -> 1em = 16px
font-size: 562%   :- dynamic sizing  100% =16px

body{
    font-size:2em;
}
h1{
    font-size:5em;
}

h1 will become 7em

when you are using em or % that value is inherited 
it is not the same with px.

we can use rem instead  which means ignore all of the parents 
settings .
root em does not get affected by the upstream changes
