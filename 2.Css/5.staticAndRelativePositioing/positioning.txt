predefined rules

1. Content is everything
inline elements takes only as much width and
as much height as the content
span with long word - large width
span with short word - short width

even though block elements take 100% width
the eight is still determined by the content

2. Order comes from code
the default layer order comes from code

3. children sit on top of parent

<div>
<h1>a programmer</h1>
</div>
h1 is going to be on top of div

position

1. Static
all html elements are static by default

2. Relative
position the element relative to how it should've
been positioned

img{
position: relative;
left: 30px;
}
it should be pushed 30px from the left of the previous
position.

coordinates - Top Bottom Left Right

for ex: go to index.html

3. Absolute

I've got an image that's inside a div So the div is colored red and it has a relative
Now our image is nested inside that div. And I've given it an absolute position.
Now if I changed the right coordinate property to 30 pixels it's not going to shift
left by 30 pixels. No. In fact it's going to shift to the right of the screen.

with absolute positioning we are positioning the element.
relative to its parent

it affects the flow .

4. Fixed
