• Adding JavaScript to your websites

javascript works really similarly as Css.
So we can add INLINE javascript by simply
adding an attribute into the tag.
for example in the body I'm going to add 
an attribute called onload and what this 
means is that when the body of our Web site 
gets loaded up then whatever javascript we
place inside these two quotation marks will 
get carried up.

• Inline JavaScript

ex:-
<body onload="alert('Hello There!');">
.....
....
...
</body>

• Internal JavaScript

syntax:
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("Hello");
</script>

• External javascript

syntax:
    <!-- External Css -->
    <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

• Note:-
CSS You always want to put it right at the top just 
below the title usually but with javascript it's the 
opposite story because inside our script if we tried 
to change an HTML element that does not yet exist 
then it will fail.

• ex:-

index.js:-
document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML="Good Bye";

<script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<h1>Hello</h1>

This will fail because the h1 element is 
created  after the script is executed.
so,best practice is always to put the script 
right at the end just before the closing body tag.

• Note:-
added benefit of this is if you have a lot of javascript 
code which usually is a little bit more time consuming 
to run then at least all of the content of your web site 
will have been loaded up for the users to see and the parts 
that they can perceive like the script codes happens afterwards.
So your website looks like it loads faster.
Whereas if you put the script rather the top on the browser 
has to go through all of the code before it can display all 
of the elements that it might look like your web site is taking 
a long time to load up which nobody has the patience for right now.
